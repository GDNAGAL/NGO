    <p class="card-text">At Dog Home Foundation, we are committed to providing comprehensive and advanced medical treatment for ill, injured, accidental, and wounded animals. Our team of expert doctors and paravets are skilled in handling a wide range of veterinary cases, both on the streets and within our shelter. We utilize state-of-the-art machinery and diagnostic tools to ensure accurate assessments and effective treatment plans.</p>
    <p>When an animal is brought to us requiring medical attention, our experienced doctors and paravets immediately spring into action. They conduct thorough examinations, taking into account the animal's symptoms, medical history, and any visible injuries. Our team understands the importance of swift and accurate diagnoses, as they form the basis for effective treatment.</p>

    <p>To aid in diagnosis, we have access to high-tech machinery such as X-ray equipment. This allows us to capture detailed images of bones, organs, and internal structures, helping us identify fractures, abnormalities, or other issues that may not be visible externally. These images enable our medical professionals to make informed decisions about the best course of treatment.</p>
    <p>Blood tests are another vital diagnostic tool we employ. By analyzing blood samples, we can assess an animal's overall health, detect infections, identify underlying conditions, and monitor organ function. This valuable information guides our doctors in tailoring treatment plans specifically for each animal's needs.</p>

    <p>For animals in need of rehabilitation and physical therapy, we offer hydrotherapy and physiotherapy services. Hydrotherapy involves the use of water-based exercises to aid in recovery, increase mobility, and reduce pain. Our specially designed facilities and trained therapists ensure that animals receive the appropriate hydrotherapy sessions to promote healing and strengthen their muscles.</p>
    <p>Physiotherapy focuses on exercises, stretches, and manual therapies that improve mobility, enhance range of motion, and alleviate discomfort. Our dedicated team of therapists work closely with each animal, customizing treatment plans to address their specific injuries and rehabilitation requirements. By utilizing these therapies, we aim to optimize recovery and enhance the quality of life for the animals under our care.</p>
    <p><img src="Assets/dog-2-Treatment.jpg" class="img-fluid" height="800" width="1100" alt=""></p>
    <p>Additionally, we leverage biochemistry analysis to gain insights into an animal's metabolic profile, organ function, and nutritional status. This helps us identify any imbalances, deficiencies, or abnormalities that may impact their overall well-being. Based on these results, our doctors can prescribe appropriate medications, dietary modifications, or supplements to support the animal's health and recovery.</p>
    <p>At Dog Home Foundation, our commitment to providing advanced medical treatment goes hand in hand with our dedication to compassionate care. We understand the physical and emotional needs of these animals and strive to create a healing environment that nurtures their well-being.</p>
    <p>By utilizing high-tech machinery, such as X-rays, blood tests, hydrotherapy, physiotherapy, and biochemistry analysis, we ensure that every ill, injured, accidental, and wounded animal receives the best possible care. Our expert medical team works tirelessly to develop tailored treatment plans, combining expertise with compassion to give these animals the opportunity to heal, regain their strength, and ultimately find their forever homes.</p>
