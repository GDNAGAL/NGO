    <h4>Giving a Safe Place To All Animals</h4>
    <p class="card-text">At Dog Home Foundation, we are committed to providing comprehensive rehabilitation services for stray animals in need. We believe that every animal deserves a chance at a better life, and our rehabilitation program aims to improve their physical and emotional well-being.</p>
    <p>Our dedicated team of veterinarians, caregivers, and volunteers work tirelessly to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome stray animals. We understand the challenges faced by these animals, who often suffer from malnutrition, injuries, and neglect. Through our rehabilitation program, we strive to give them a second chance and help them find loving forever homes.</p>

    <p>Our rehabilitation program focuses on several key areas, including medical care, nutritional support, behaviour training, and socialization. We provide necessary medical treatments, vaccinations, and surgeries to address any health issues the animals may have. We also work on rehabilitating their behaviour, helping them overcome fear, anxiety, and other challenges they may have developed on the streets.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, our team ensures that the animals receive proper nutrition, love, and attention while they are in our care. We create a safe and comfortable environment where they can heal, recover, and regain their trust in humans.</p>
